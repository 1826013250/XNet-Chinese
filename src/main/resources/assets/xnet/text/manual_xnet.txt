{b}Introduction
{n:intro}
XNet is all about networking and transporting items, liquids,
energy and information through the world. Using cables you connect
various machines and blocks and in the controller you configure
how things move through the created network. A cable can send
all kinds of information. You don't need different cables for
items, energy, or liquids.

XNet is also very efficient and scalable. Cables are not tile
entities and you can create huge cable networks without
performance differences.

{b}Basic Concepts
{n:basic}
A network (or local network) is represented by a number of machines
and blocks connected using cables and connectors and one controller.
Every network needs one controller (and not more) and it is the
block that does the actual work.

On a single network you can have up to eight channels for items,
liquids, energy, and information. You can configure these channels
in the UI of the controller.

Every channel can be connected to as many blocks and machines as
you want using connectors.

Using routers one can connect multiple networks. A single router
can connect up to 6 networks (one for each side). To do that simply
connect the network to the router using a normal connector.

Channels are only visible to the router if they are named. This can
be done in the UI of the controller. These channels are called
'named channels'.

A named channel can then be published in the router by giving it
a 'published name'. Only then can this channel be used by other
networks (either local or remote).
