1.7.4:
- WARNING: Do not load any worlds with XNet 1.7.3 or earlier if you last saved them with XNet 1.7.4 or later!
- Joseph fixed log warnings due to tile entities being registered with names like "minecraft:xnet_facade" instead of "xnet:facade".
- Fixed a problem with the redstone proxy blocks being breakable by hand (and not giving any drops)
- Fixed a possible crash with the wireless routers when used in different (unloaded) dimensions

1.7.3:
- Fixed a few baked models that didn't test for null state. This fixes XNet for recent versions of Forge

1.7.2:
- Fixed a very stupid bug in the item handling when there were multiple extraction points and some of these were disabled by color mask and/or redstone mode. As soon as it tested one of those extraction points it would ignore all remaining extraction points if the conditions didn't match

1.7.1:
- Reduced power consumption of the wireless router. It was a bit too much. Changed the name of the config so that everyone will get the new values
- New feature to extract a specific amount of items per tick

1.7.0:
- Made compatible with the latest McJtyLib (3.0.0)
- New wireless router. A wireless router must be connected to a routing network (using the special routing cables) to a normal router. All published channels on that router will be made available remotely to another wireless router. Note that a wireless router needs an antenna to work
